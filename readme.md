### PROJECT BLOG ###

#This blog site was created to document the progress of my fourth year project for BSc. (Hons) in Information Technology
#For Waterford Institute of Technology. The blog is part of a series of prototypes developed for semester 1 of the project
#To demonstrate that my chosen technologies work together. The blog is built using Node.js and Express.js, with the data being stored
#on mLab. The hosted site can be found at: https://dleniston-project-blog.herokuapp.com
