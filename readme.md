### PROJECT BLOG ###

This blog site was created to document the progress of my fourth year project for BSc. (Hons) in Information Technology
for _Waterford Institute of Technology_. The blog is part of a series of prototypes developed for semester 1 of the project module
to demonstrate that my chosen technologies work together. The blog is built using Node.js and Express.js, with the data being stored
on mLab. The hosted site can be found on [Heroku](https://dleniston-project-blog.herokuapp.com)
